### **Overview**

This project was created for STA 523 Exam 2 (2019 Fall).

I created a news dashboard using R Shiny. It sources US news from [News API](https://newsapi.org/){:target="_blank"} which allows free access to up to 500 news per day. Users can read recent news headlines, or use key words to search for historical articles.

Refer to [here](https://christineshen421.shinyapps.io/News/){:target="_blank"} for the shiny app, and [this repo](https://github.com/christineymshen/RShiny_News){:target="_blank"} for the codes.
