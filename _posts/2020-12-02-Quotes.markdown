I will put random quotes I like here until I can figure out a better place for them.

<blockquote>
  Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.<br>
    - Carl Sagan
</blockquote>

I came across this in the book "Algorithms to live by" by Tom Griffiths and Brian Christian.

<blockquote>
    I like crossing the imaginary boundaries people set up between different fields — it’s very refreshing. <br>
    — Maryam Mirzakhani (1977-2017)
</blockquote>

I came across this while watching an introductory video on algebraic geometry. Link [here](https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/05-14-2019/math-frontiers-webinar-algebraic-geometry){:target="_blank"}.

<blockquote>
    The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard.<br>
    - John Tukey
</blockquote>

Came across this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxdGIA8qZ0A){:target="_blank"}. 

I don't particularly feel strongly for this, just think it's an interesting thought. The idea of, if I suddenly become interested in a certain field, and then I can just shift gears to that field and utilize my quantitative skills there, is kind of uncomfortable to me. Going into something new always sounds stressful to me. I guess this boils down to my subconscious stubborn belief that I need to be able to understand everything myself in order to get work done.
