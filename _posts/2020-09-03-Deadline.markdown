I posted in wechat moment today saying, deadline is the single most important source of productivity for somebody procrastinating like me. 

A friend replied, don't worry, it's true for the entire human race. 

Indeed she meant "deadlines" when she replied me. But this reminds me of a podcast I listened to a while ago, and the idea that the destiny of death of human race hugely impacts how we think and behave.

The hosts were discussing how science fictions reflect on topics such as what make us human different from other species. They mentioned a book by J.R.R. Tolkien where he wrote about how Dwarves, Elves and human were created to each possess different gifts. Elves are blessed with eternal life but with a certain destiny, yet humans are "blessed" with death and uncertainties that in some sense they can make an impact to their lives. And in one story, it turns out that what human have invented, for example, the stream engine -- Dwarves have invented these things long time ago, yet they didn't turn the invention into a flourishment of other creations as human did becasue they were not in a hurry.

In a way, because we know we have limited time, we have to strive to make every bit of time counts. 

I don't know what this means/ implies. It's just the interesting thought of the day.
