I came across *Negative Combinatorics* while working on HW1 from STA 732. It's just one technique needed (after googling) to get me through the problem set, but somehow I find it far more interesting than the problem set.

Updated 20210514

I started this on the date of HW1 submission (and that date is special for at least two other reasons). And now I'm finishing it up in May after the whole semester has ended. 

Suppose a set S has n elements, number of subsets of S of size k is:

\begin{equation\*}
  {n \choose k}  = \frac{n(n-1) \dots (n-k+1)}{k!}.
\end{equation\*}

Now if there were a set with -2 number of element, how many subsets of size 3 would it have? We can try naively applying the same formula:

\begin{equation\*}
  {-2 \choose 3}  = \frac{(-2)(-3)(-4)}{3!} = -4.
\end{equation\*}

This gives us a number, but how to understand it?

Note that a *set*, by definition can only consist of unique elements. here we introduce the notion of multisets, with unbounded multiplicity, i.e., the following are three different and yet valid multisets: {x,x}, {x,y}, and {y,y}.

Now coming back to the question above, let S = {x,y}, where both x and y are "negative elements", i.e., they can be seleted more than once into a multiset. Then the unique subsets of S of size 3 are: {x,x,x}, {y,y,y}, {x,x,y}, {x,y,y}, a total of 4 subsets, which matches with the number 4 we got above. But then what about the negative signï¼Ÿ Here let's say that a multiset with k negative elements has weight $$ (-1)^k $$. And hence we have 

**Theorem**: For a set S with m negative elements, $$ {-m \choose k}$$ is the sum of the weights of all the k-element multiset-subsets of S.

**Proof**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  {-m \choose k}  &= \frac{(-m)(-m-1) \dots (-m-k+1)}{k!} \\
  &= (-1)^k {m+k-1 \choose k}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we need to show that the number of unique multisets by choosing k from m elements, is indeed $$ {m+k-1 \choose k} $$. We can use a counting method called "stars and bars". This might be rather basic, but it's the first time I come across this idea. I find it quite interesting. 

Now assume I want to choose n elements from 2, because the order isn't important, so this is equivalent to ... imagine we have n stars, lying in one line

$$ * * * \dots * * * $$

We want to put one bar in between to separate these stars into two groups, for example this is one possibility:

$$ * | * * \dots * * * $$

How many different ways are there to place this bar? This is exactly equivalent to the problem above. Here there are in total (n+1) places for me to place this one bar, and hence it's $$ {n+1 \choose 1} = {n+2-1 \choose 2-1}$$. And if we generalize it a m choose k problem, obviously the answer is

$$
  {m+k-1 \choose m-1} = {m+k-1 \choose k}.
$$

This completes the proof. 

This also works for hybrid sets, i.e., sets with both positive and negative elements:
+ a positive element can only be chosen once, with weight 1
+ a negative element can be chosen any number of times, with weight (-1)

For example, consider set S = {a, x, y} where a is a positive element, while x and y are negative elements. Therefore in total S has (-1) elements. So how many subsets (potentially multisets) of size 3 does S have?

1. For subsets with only negative elements, each subset/ multiset has weight of $$ (-1)^3 = (-1) $$ and there are a total of 4 subsets
2. For subsets with one positive element a, and two of the negative elements. The weight is 1, and there are a total of 3 subsets.
3. All together, the sum of the weights of all the unique subsets is 3-4=-1. This is same as $$ -1 \choose 3 $$.

*This is where I decided to stop. I did not try to further prove the case for hybrid sets.*
