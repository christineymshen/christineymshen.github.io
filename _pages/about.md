I am a first year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at Duke University. My research interests are still developing. I'm broadly interested in Bayesian methods and multivariate analysis with applications in social sciences.

I enjoy studying statistical theory and hope to be able to develop theories and methodologies. I find myself drawn to further studies of mathematics. I like coding, especially algorithmic optimization -- I'm obsessed with (even just temporarily) reducing entropy in my life in every possible way. Generally I'm curious to learn about different perspectives to look at the world.

Outside of Statistics, a few things I've been enjoying doing regularly are: yoga, meditation, and tennis.
