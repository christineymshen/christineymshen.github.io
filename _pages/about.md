I have just completed my Master's degree from the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at Duke University. I will start my PhD (a.k.a. permanent head damage) here in August. 

My research interests are still developing. My interests lie broadly at the intersection of statistics, computer science, psychology, and philosophy. I'm interested in understanding Consciousness and Theory of Mind. I hope to use quantitative tools to better understand the human minds. 

I enjoy studying statistical theory and hope to be able to develop theory and methodologies myself. I find myself drawn to further studies of mathematics. I like coding, especially algorithmic optimization -- I'm obsessed with (even just temporarily) reducing entropy in my life in every possible way. Generally I'm curious to learn about different perspectives to look at the world.

Currently I'm enjoying my cannot-go-back-home-yet-still-hope-it-never-ends summer days. I'm slowly brownion-motioning in things I'm interested in, and fortunately with people I like, a lot. 

The icon of my webpage is the Chinese character of my last name, said to be written by [Wang XiZhi](http://www.sfds.cn/6C88/1025905.html), or at least in his calligraphy style I guess.
