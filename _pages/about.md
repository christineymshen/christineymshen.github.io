I am currently a second year Master student in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at Duke University.

My research interests are still developing. I enjoy studying statistical theory and hope to be able to develop theory and methodologies myself. I'm broadly interested in Bayesian methods, probablistic modeling, graphical models, and generally applications of statistics in social science. I find myself drawn to further studies of mathematics. I like coding, especially algorithmic optimization -- I'm obsessed with (even just temporarily) reducing entropy in my life in every possible way. Generally I'm curious to learn about different perspectives to look at the world.

Currently I'm working on a research project on scalable inference for probit network models.
