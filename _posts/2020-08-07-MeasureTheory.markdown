Every once a while I get myself into the situation where I need to make a choice. I clearly know the pros and cons, I (sort of) know what I want to do, yet my mind keeps asking "what if"?

This time the question is whether or not to take measure theory in the next semester, and if yes, with how many other courses.

Came across some interesting thoughts referenced by [this article](https://cosx.org/2014/12/the-story-about-measure-theory/){:target="_blank"}.

Somehow I have the feeling that, studying measure theory sounds like a way to find out more about the *truth* of the world, to learn the rules in order to play more interesting games, and it's a paradigm shift. 

While it is always nice to learn new techniques, I find it inspiring and fulfilling every time I'm able to learn a little bit more about the underlying patterns.

So I know I want to take this course now and I know what this decision takes. Hopefully I have learned it enough by now what happens when I don't listen to my own intuition...
