I came across negative combinatorics while working on HW1 from STA 732. Although it's just one technique needed (after googling) to get me through the problem set, somehow I find it far more interesting than the problem set ...

20210510: I started this post during the semester, and obviously I didn't have time/ bother to finish it. I ... just checked that it was indeed the date I turned in HW1. It's a "relief" to know that I didn't start this post purely because of the special date ... 

Anyway, apparently now I'd better first fix KaTex before I can finish this post ...
