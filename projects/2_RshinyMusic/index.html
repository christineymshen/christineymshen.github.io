  <article class="post-content R-Shiny Pacific Music clearfix">
    <h3 id="overview"><strong>Overview</strong></h3>

<p>This is the Final Project for STA 523 (2019 Fall).</p>

<p>This is a group project where four of us put together a music app with four gadgets, including music search by artist, genre, lyrics analysis using NLP techniques and music recommendation based on peronality test.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="https://christineshen421.shinyapps.io/pacificMusic" target="_blank">here</a> for the shiny app, and <a href="https://github.com/christineymshen/RShiny_pacificMusic" target="_blank">this repo</a> for the codes.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts"><strong>Thoughts</strong></h3>

<p>This was the second R shiny project for me. I remember there was some time between this project and <a href="/projects/1_RshinyNews/">Exam 2</a> that when I started thinking about this, I already can’t quite remember what I did with the last one. But still it was much easier to get started. I worked on the <em>User Manual</em> and <em>Musician</em> tabs in this shiny app. Basically I built it on top of the experience from the last project, and learned a few new tools along the way.</p>

<p>Our group name is <strong>Pacific</strong> because all of us come from Asia Pacific, despite one of us is from India and I don’t think India has anything to do with the Pacific Ocean. But anyway, none of us had the extra energy to be creative during the final exam period.</p>

<p>What I miss the most about this project is actually the time with friends. We didn’t get to discuss much during those brain-frying weeks, but the sense of working alongside someone whom I trust and like, is reassuring. As an extreme introvert, I treasure the time, however little that is, spent with people I like and feel comfortable with. And I’ve always felt lucky to have worked on this project with these few interesting souls.</p>

<p>One technical issue at the time of project submission was, whenever I deploy the shiny app, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DataTable</code> in the <em>Lyrics</em> - <em>WORD CLOUD</em> tab wouldn’t work properly. However, it works if others deploy it (without any change to the codes). Because of this, I had to wake up my groupmate at 7am on the submission day. While it’s a fun memory now, I’m sure it was a true\(\cdot\)nightmare for my poor friend. Somehow, magically, I found that this is no longer an issue when I deployed it just now on the shiny server. So the mystery was forever left in December 2019.</p>
